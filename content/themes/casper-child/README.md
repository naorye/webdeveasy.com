# Casper Child
A Ghost-like WordPress theme

Casper *(for WordPress)* is a simple yet beautiful theme for bloggers.

This is the starter child theme for [Casper](https://github.com/lacymorrow/casper/), used for editing and making changes to the original theme.
The purpose of a child theme is to make personal theme changes in an isolated location, so that your changes will not get blown away when you update the parent theme.

### [Demo](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/casper/)

### [Download Casper from the WordPress.org Theme Directory](http://wordpress.org/themes/casper)

## Usage

Install and activate [Casper](https://github.com/lacymorrow/casper/). You need the most recent version of the theme. Once Casper is working, upload the `casper-child` folder into your WordPress theme directory, alongside the `casper` folder. In your dashboard, activate the Casper Child theme to make it live.

By default a `style.css` is included with which you can write CSS rules to override Casper styles.

The `functions.php` file works just as a normal theme's functions file. It is loaded before the parent theme functions and is able to overwrite parent theme functions by defining them here.
